# Generalized Linear Model for Car Insurance Pricing

## Introduction

### Generalized Linear Model (GLM) - Two modelling approach:

Pure premium approach : Build a single model for pure premium - Generally straightforward to implement
- Only a single model needs to be built
- No need to split variable offsets
- Results often very similar to frequency-severity approach

Frequency-Severity approach : Build one model for claim frequency and another for claims severity - Additional work for additional insight
- May yield meaningful insights about data
- Can choose from several well-known and well-understood distributions
